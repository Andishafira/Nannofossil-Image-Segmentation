# Nannofossil-Image-Segmentation
The effect of climate change has been substantial all over the world, and researchers have used various tools and objects to analyze its occurrence in the past to understand its relation in the present and future, one of them being nannofossil. True to their class name, nannofossils can only be seen with the help of a microscope because their sizes vary from 0.25 to 25 nm. To properly identify the existence of nannofossils, the microscope captures or imageries could be additionally tweaked with the help of image processing techniques. This paper proposes an image segmentation process to detect the nannofossils that utilize various classic image analysis methods. Four image filtering techniques will be tested with the images: Gaussian, mean, median, and bilateral filter. The best result is then combined with the quantile thresholding method to isolate the required pixel values and ends with the usage of multiple morphological operations to ramp up the quality. The result shows that the combination of image analysis methods can provide a quite promising Mean Intersect over Union (MIoU) value when compared to the nannofossil imagesâ€™ ground truth.
